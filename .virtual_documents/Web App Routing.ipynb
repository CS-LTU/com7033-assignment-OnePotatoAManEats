    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
     This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
     This data set is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data</p>
